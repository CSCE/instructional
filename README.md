## Raspberry Pi Introduction

This was designed for younger students, taking up about 1 hour, requiring Raspberry Pi's for every student, plus one additional Pi to act as a file and DHCP server, and taking them from plugging in what's needed to use a Pi, to working with a terminal briefly, and starting the desktop.
