Instructional materials &amp; tutorials for introducing computer science concepts to students.

## Raspberry Pi Introduction

This was designed for younger students, taking up about 1 hour, requiring Raspberry Pi's for every student, plus one additional Pi to act as a file and DHCP server, and taking them from plugging in what's needed to use a Pi, to working with a terminal briefly, and starting the desktop.

## Steam account hack attempt

Contains a few screenshots related to an attempted hack of Guard13007's Steam account. To be used in some sort of presentation about the importance of using different passwords for different servies, and how problems can be mitigated when a password is stolen by having multiple factor authentication.

## Virtual Machines

Currently has one work-in-progress document introducing VirtualBox and setting up a virtual Ubuntu machine. Blame stevenwashere for typos.
